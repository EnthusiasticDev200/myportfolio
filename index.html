    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate junior backend developer skilled in building robust, secure, and scalable server-side applications with Node.js, Express, and MySQL.
      While I have not yet worked professionally in a tech firm, I have been actively building real-world backend solutions that solve practical problems.
      I enjoy translating business needs into efficient backend architectures, focusing on clean code, security, and performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am working on a Salon Management System backend designed to enhance both customer and stylist experiences.
      My approach involves blending database efficiency with modern server technologies to deliver smooth, real-time interactions.
